## Interesting Information

This application was written as a static class - if we had more time we would refactor into object instances.
To run the application, simply run the file.

```
Expected output:
A new file with the name "blueTest.bmp" will appear in the "./src/resources/" folder.
The image will have 1/2 the red value as the previous image.
```
